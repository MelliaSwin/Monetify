# Monetify

Monetify is an innovative project that leverages artificial intelligence to transform any input image into the style of the renowned impressionist painter, Claude Monet.

## Overview

Monetify uses advanced neural networks and machine learning algorithms to recreate vibrant colors, fluid brushstrokes, and unique artistic nuances found in Monet's masterpieces. The project showcases the potential of AI in digital artistry by blending modern technology with timeless creativity.

## How It Works

- **Neural Style Transfer (NST):**  
  Monetify applies NST to combine the content of the userâ€™s image with the stylistic elements of Monet's paintings, capturing his signature brushstrokes, color palettes, and textures.
  
- **Dataset:**  
  The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 images of Claude Monet's paintings, enabling it to learn and replicate his distinctive style.

- **Training Process:**  
  - **Epochs:** The model generated 64 images per epoch over 2500 epochs.
  - **Learning Rate:** 0.001
  - **Style Representation:** The style transfer relies on calculating the Gram matrix to capture and apply Monet's unique style to input images.
  - **Processing Time:** Approximately 30 seconds per image transformation.

## Why Monetify?

- **Inspiration:**  
  To bring the timeless beauty of Claude Monet's impressionist art into the digital era.
  
- **Innovation:**  
  To explore and expand the potential of AI in creative expression, merging contemporary image processing with classical art techniques.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning:** Advanced neural networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- **Style Transfer:** Neural Style Transfer (NST) to refine images
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface that allows seamless image transformation
